markup:
  # Reverting to Hugo-standard Goldmark parser and will handle typographical niceties
  # on own (i.e., manually fixing them in my content files),
  # due to Goldmark's ongoing and unlikely-to-be-resolved issues with typography:
  # -- e.g.,
  # https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/7289,
  # https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/issues/39#issuecomment-564810327, and
  # https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/issues/180
