# Goldmark Typographer issues

Here are examples of issues found with the `Typographer` extension in the [Goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) Markdown parser, which [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) uses. I hope this will help [`@yuin`](https://github.com/yuin) and PR-submitters resolve them; see [this comment](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/issues/180#issuecomment-769640321).<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.75rem;">Repo for this site: [https://github.com/brycewray/gm-typographer](https://github.com/brycewray/gm-typographer).</span>

For each issue, you'll see:

- The Markdown
- The **correct** result (in U.S. English)
- The current Goldmark/Typographer result
